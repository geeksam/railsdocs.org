		<a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/">Getting Started with Rails - RailsGuides</a><br/>
		The RailsGuides are an excellent resource. Part tutorial, part API
		documentation. Use these to get started as well as to answer advanced
		questions.

		This is pretty cool. Besides the creative presentation (zombies), the
		teaching method is unique: it doesn't merely "feed you
		facts". Instead, it leads you down a path of figuring things out for
		yourself.

## Ruby as a First Programming Language ##

[Introduction to Ruby](http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/references/ruby/doc_bundle/Tutorial/)  
It's not fancy, but it's written extremely well. If you have a Mac you
can get started easily.

[Try Ruby](http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0)  
Learn ruby in a browser. You really can learn to program, and with Ruby, right in the web
browser. Enter "help" and you'll get a great 15-minute introduction.



## Ruby for Programmers ##

[PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby Comparison]()  
is an excellent chart that's just the facts. Great if you're coming
from another language.

[Ruby in Twenty Minutes](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/)  
in tutorial form.

[Programming Ruby](http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/)  
a decent online book, although not perfect. It would benefit from 
a stronger editorial voice. For example, features and libraries (like Net::HTTP)
are presented without advising which to avoid.
