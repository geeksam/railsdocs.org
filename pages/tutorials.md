## Ruby as a First Programming Language ##

[Introduction to Ruby](http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/references/ruby/doc_bundle/Tutorial/)  
It's not fancy, but it's written extremely well. If you have a Mac you
can get started easily.

[Try Ruby](http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0)  
Learn ruby in a browser. You really can learn to program, and with Ruby, right in the web
browser. Enter "help" and you'll get a great 15-minute introduction.


## Ruby for Programmers ##

[PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby Comparison]()  
is an excellent chart that's just the facts. Great if you're coming
from another language.

[Ruby in Twenty Minutes](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/)  
in tutorial form.

[Programming Ruby](http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/)  
is a great online book, still in tutorial form.




## Rails ##

[RailsGuides - Getting Started with Rails](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/)  
The RailsGuides are an excellent resource. Part tutorial, part API
documentation. Use these to get started as well as to answer advanced
questions.


## Capistrano ##
