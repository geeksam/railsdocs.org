## Fork Away ##

You can literally submit an edit to this site in under one
minute. It's an
[opensource project hosted on Github](https://github.com/dogweather/railsdocs.org/tree/gh-pages),
written in
[Markdown](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/),
processed by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and served via
[Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/). Make your edits and send a
Pull Request.

The one real content page for the time being is
[index.md in the root directory of the gh-pages branch](https://github.com/dogweather/railsdocs.org/blob/gh-pages/index.md).


## Planned: Automatic _Edit this Page_ Links ##

I'm working on the Jekyll/liquid programming to have each page link to
its location in the Github repository. This will make it as easy to
edit as a wiki.


## Questions? ##
