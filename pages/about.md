This site's mission is focussed and opinionated. It will

* **be extremely quick and responsive**, because otherwise the 
    flow of work is interrupted;
* **be opensource and trivially easy to contribute to**;
* **link to the best docs first**. What's "best"? A project's page 
    that shows app developers how to use its API;
* **focus on how to use things**, not how things work;
* **link to great resources**, rather than re-invent the wheel.


## How This Site Works ##

[I](http://www.weblaws.org/robb/about) develop this site with help from
[Github Pages](http://pages.github.com),
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com),
[Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com), and
[Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/).
