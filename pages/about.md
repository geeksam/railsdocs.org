## I made this site because I needed it ##

It ought to be useful for others too. Google doesn't always give the
best answer first. Features come in via mixins, modules, and sometimes
hard-to-determine places, so it's not clear where to look. Many links
in the API are
[dead ends](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/ActiveModelHelper.html)
or
[very oddly formatted thus hiding the content](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers.html)
due to quirks of the docs generator.

I kept having a sense of deja vu; "I know there's a great page that
lists all of these in one place, but I forget where."


## I'm a Rails App Developer ##

I spend my days working with Rails and so it's important to me to have
tools that match my working style.

## This site is focused and opinionated ## 

It will;

* **focus on how to use things** from an app developer's perspective;
* **be extremely quick and responsive**, because otherwise the 
    flow of work is interrupted;
* **be opensource and trivially easy to contribute to**;
* **link to the best docs first**;
* **link to great resources**, rather than re-invent the wheel.


## This is a precompiled static site ##

[I](http://www.weblaws.org/robb/about) develop this site with help from
[Github Pages](http://pages.github.com),
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com),
[Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com), and
