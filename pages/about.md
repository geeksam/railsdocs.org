This site's mission is focussed and opinionated. It will

* **Show how to use things**, not how things work;
* **Link to great resources**, rather than re-inventing the wheel;
* **Be extremely quick and responsive**, because otherwise the 
    flow of work is interrupted;
* **Link to the best docs first**. What's "best"? The project page 
    that shows app developers how to use its API.
