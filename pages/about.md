## This site exists because ##

Google doesn't always give the best answer first.  

It's nice to have something which is more succint than the
[Guides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/index.html), yet shows a feature's
_full_ api.

API docs are often
[tucked away in hard-to-find places](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2094678/rails-3-0-actioncontrollerbase-render)
because they're brought in via mixins or modules.

Links in the API are often
[dead ends](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/ActiveModelHelper.html)
or
[very oddly formatted and hide the content](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers.html)
due to quirks of the docs generator.




## This site is focused and opinionated ## 

It;

* **focuses on how to use things** from an app developer's perspective;
* **is extremely quick and responsive** so that the flow of work isn't
    interrupted;
* **is opensource**;
* **is trivially easy to contribute to**;
* **links to the best docs first**;
* **links to great resources**, rather than re-inventing the wheel.


## This is a precompiled static site ##

It was developed with help from
[Github Pages](http://pages.github.com),
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com),
[Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com), and
[Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/).



## Created by a Rails App Developer ##

I spend my days working with Rails and so it's important to me to have
tools that match my working style.
