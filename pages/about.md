## I made this site because I needed it ##

It ought to be useful for others too.


## I'm a Rails App Developer ##

I spend my days working with Rails and so it's important to me to have
tools that match my working style.

* [Personal home page](http://www.weblaws.org/robb/about)



## This site is focused and opinionated ## 

It will;

* **focus on how to use things** from an app developer's perspective;
* **be extremely quick and responsive**, because otherwise the 
    flow of work is interrupted;
* **be opensource and trivially easy to contribute to**;
* **link to the best docs first**;
* **link to great resources**, rather than re-invent the wheel.


## This is a precompiled static site ##

[I](http://www.weblaws.org/robb/about) develop this site with help from
[Github Pages](http://pages.github.com),
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com),
[Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com), and
[Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/).
