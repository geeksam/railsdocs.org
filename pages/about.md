This site's mission is focussed and opinionated. It will

* **be extremely quick and responsive**, because otherwise the 
    flow of work is interrupted;
* **be opensource and trivially easy to contribute to**;
* **link to the best docs first**. What's "best"? A project's page 
    that shows app developers how to use its API;
* **focus on how to use things**, not how things work;
* **link to great resources**, rather than re-invent the wheel.
